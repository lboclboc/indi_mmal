Notes
-----
When getting a raw image (jpeg+raw), the first part of the file is a normal jpeg, in the remaining part (18711040 bytes) then
comes a 32768 bytes header starting with the text "BRCMo".
The raw image then follows which 18678272 bytes with rows 6112 bytes long: 6084 bytes (4056*1.5!!) of pixels (groups of 3),  12 blanking?? and 16 image related data.
In total 3056 rows with the last 16 rows containing other data (even in the last 28 bytes of the rows).

Pixels are ordered by | Bm | Gm | Bl+Gl |
                      | Gm | Rm | Gl+Rl |

m : MSB 8 bits, l = LSB 4 bits

MMAL Debugging
--------------
Debug camera by adding dtdebug=1 to /boot/config.txt, reboot and run sudo vcdbg log assert

Tune up logging levels:
    vcgencmd set_logging level=3072

Log messages:
    vcdbg log msg

Set logging level for category:
    vcdbg log level <category> e w i t

Available commands to vcgencmd:
    vcgencmd commands

Displays the error log status of the various VideoCore software areas:
